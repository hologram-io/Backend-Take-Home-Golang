# Stop

Unless you are an employee at Hologram updating part of the take home interview you should not be making pull requests to the repo.

Making pull requests shows everyone your work and there is no way for us to remove it from the repo's history. While not entirely disqualifying it is definitely a yellow flag on our end.

So please, for our sake and yours, do not make pull requests.
