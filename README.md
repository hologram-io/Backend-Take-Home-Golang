## Introduction

Hello engineering candidate! This is Hologram's take-home exercise for software engineers with a backend or full-stack focus. The challenge will be to implement a “usage parser” class to handle several types of incoming data strings, differentiated by id, and parse their constituent data. To facilitate this, we’ve done the TDD part for you: you have a set of tests that should pass when the class is complete!

## Setup

The tests require `cmp` to run. There is a basic `go.mod` that should install it via `go get`. To run the tests, just enter the command `go test`. To see more detailed output from the tests, run `go test -v`.

## Evaluation

We'll be evaluating each submission based on the following criteria:

**Passing Tests -** Your code should fulfill the basic requirements of the challenge. We’ll expect to see the original tests passing for your code.

**Readability / Maintainability -** This isn’t full production code, but the results of your solution should be well-organized and readable. We value long-term maintainability of code.

## Requirements

**Parser Class**

The skeleton parser class has been provided in the repository. The `Parse` method should accept  an array of strings. It should perform the parsing and return an array of `UsageResult`'s containing the id and the available values as depicted below. Values not present in the parsing strings should be included in the returned object as the type default.


**ID Parsing**

All strings will have at least two comma-separated values. The first value will always be the `id`.

- IDs ending with 4 should use the “extended” string parsing scheme to store the data
- IDs ending with 6 should use the “hex” string parsing scheme
- All other IDs should use the “basic” string parsing scheme


**Basic String Parsing**

Basic strings are comma separated with just two values, the id and the bytes used, both integers.

`<id>,<bytes_used>`


**Extended String Parsing**

Extended strings are comma separated with values for multiple fields. All values are integers except `dmcc` which is a string. Fields are always in the same order.

`<id>,<dmcc>,<mnc>,<bytes_used>,<cellid>`


**Hex String Parsing**

`<id>,<hex>`

Hex strings consist of two comma separate values: the id, and a string of hex bytes representing more rich data. To access the values, the hex string will have to be parsed.

The hex string is a 24-character (12-byte) non-separated string with fixed position elements noted below. Each byte of the string (**two characters, e.g. `a0`**) is part of a value. Hex values should be converted to appropriate types when they parsed into fields. All values are integers (e.g. `3a09` would be `14857`) except for `ip` which is a string.

- Bytes 1-2 → `mnc`
- Bytes 3-4 > `bytes_used`
- Bytes 5-8 → `cellid`
- Bytes 9-12 → `ip`
    - String
    - Each byte is one segment of the ip, separated by a period: e.g. `c0a80001` would be `"192.168.0.1"`


**Example parsed objects:**

```go
[]*usage_parser.UsageResult{
  &{
    id: 7294,
	mnc: 182,
	bytes_used: 293451,
	dmcc: nil,
	cellid: 31194,
	ip: s"192.168.0.1",
  },
  &{
	id: 3,
	mnc: 9523,
	bytes_used: 1024,
	dmcc: "a03",
	cellid: 193955,
	ip: nil,
  }
}
```

## Submitting your exercise

When you have something you're happy with, please respond with the URL of your repo, and we'll take a look. While it’s intended to be possible to do very well in only a couple of hours, time pressure is not intended to be a factor, so feel free to take a week to find time to work on it, or longer if your schedule requires.
